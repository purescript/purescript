* Significantly improved `Record`/`Row`-related error messages

  The problems of the prior Record/Row-related error messages
  are shown below with their updated counterparts. Vertical spacing
  in the messages is omitted for brevity.
  
  The errors `ExprDoesNotHaveType`, `PropertyIsMissing`, 
  and `AdditionalProperty` have been removed, being replaced
  with `TypesDoNotUnify` instead.

  **Case 1: lack of "expected type" distinction when it is known**

  Previously, the message would not indicate which
  of the two types was the expected type, even
  if it could be determined.
  
  Now, when this distinction is known, it is reported. 
  Note: this distinction cannot be known in all circumstances.

  Before:
  ```
  Could not match type
    X
  with type
    Y
  ```
  After:
  ```
  Expected type
    Y
  but found type
    X
  ```

  **Case 2: reporting all label differences (and only those differences) together**
  
  Before:
  ```
  Type of expression contains additional label extraLabel1
  ```
  (without any messages about more extra labels)
  
  or
  
  ```
  Type of expression lacks required label requiredLabel1
  ```
  (without any messages about more required labels)
  
  or
  
  ```
  Could not match type
    ( a :: Int
    , b :: Int
    , c :: Int
    , d :: Int
    , e :: Int
    , f :: Int
    , extraLabel1 :: Int
    , extraLabel2 :: Int
    ...
    )
  with type
    ( a :: t7
    , b :: t6
    , c :: t5
    , d :: t4
    , e :: t3
    , f :: t2
    , requiredLabel1 :: t1
    ...
    | t8
    )
  ```
  
  After:
  ```
  Expected type
    { requiredLabel1 :: t1
    ...
    | t2
    }
  but found type
    { extraLabel1 :: Int
    , extraLabel2 :: Int
    ...
    }
  ```

  **Case 3: reporting only the first `TypesDoNotUnify` error rather than all such errors on record pattern matches whose labels are a subset of the expected record's labels**

  The following behavior is unchanged, but it is explained to clarify
  the next summary.
 
  When pattern matching on a record where the pattern match's labels
  differ from the labels of the expected record (e.g. from a type signature),
  a `TypesDoNotUnify` error is thrown showing a diff between the two records' labels,
  regardless of whether their corresponding types unify.

  ```purs
  data ExpectedType = ExpectedValue
  data SomeOtherType = DifferentValue

  {-  
  Produces one error for the entire record; behavior unchanged.

    The type
      ( a :: ExpectedValue
      , b :: String
      )
    does not unify with type
      ( x :: SomeOtherType
      , y :: Int
      )
  -}
  test :: { a :: ExpectedType, b :: String } -> Int
  test { x: DifferentValue, y: 7 } = 1
  ```

  However, if the labels in the pattern match are a subset of the labels
  in the expected record, then previously a `TypesDoNotUnify` error is thrown
  for only the _first_ detected error. Now, such an error is thrown
  _for each_ type that fails to unify.

  ```purs
  data ExpectedType = ExpectedValue
  data SomeOtherType = DifferentValue

  data A = A

  -- Errors thrown in previous behavior:
  -- - under label sameLabel1, `TypesDoNotUnify ExpectedType SomeOtherType`
  --
  -- Errors thrown in new behavior:
  -- - under label sameLabel1, `TypesDoNotUnify ExpectedType SomeOtherType`
  -- - under label sameLabel2, `TypesDoNotUnify String Int`
  test :: { sameLabel1 :: ExpectedType, sameLabel2 :: String, sameLabel3 :: A } -> Int
  test { sameLabel1: DifferentValue, sameLabel2: 7, sameLabel3: A } = 1
  ```

  **Case 4: printing `Record row` using native syntax**

  | Before | After |
  | - | - |
  | `Record ()` | `{}` |
  | `Record (...)` | `{ ... }` |
