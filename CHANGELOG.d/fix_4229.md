* Fix bad interaction between module renaming and inliner

  This bug was triggered when modules that the compiler handles specially
  are shadowed by local constructors. For example, a constructor named
  `Prim` could have caused references to `Prim_1["undefined"]` to be
  produced in the compiled code, leading to a reference error at run time.
  Less severely, a constructor named `Control_Bind` would have caused the
  compiler not to inline known monadic functions, leading to slower and
  less readable compiled code.
