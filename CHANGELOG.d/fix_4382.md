* Improve error spans for class and instance declarations

  This improves the error spans for class and instance
  declarations. Instead of highlighting the entire class or instance
  declaration when `UnknownName` is thrown, the compiler now
  highlights the class name and its arguments.

  Before:
  ```purs
  [1/2 UnknownName]

    5  class G a <= F a
       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    Unknown type class G

  [2/2 UnknownName]

    7  instance G a => F a
       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    Unknown type class G
  ```

  After:
  ```purs
  [1/2 UnknownName]

    5  class G a <= F a
             ^^^

    Unknown type class G

  [2/2 UnknownName]

    7  instance G a => F a
                ^^^

    Unknown type class G
  ```
