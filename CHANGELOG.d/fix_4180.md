* Fix crash caused by polykinded instances

  A polykinded instance is a class instance where one or more of the type
  parameters has an indeterminate kind. For example, the kind of `a` in

  ```purs
  instance SomeClass (Proxy a) where ...
  ```

  is indeterminate unless it's somehow used in a constraint or functional
  dependency of the instance in a way that determines it.

  The above instance would not have caused the crash; instead, instances needed
  to be of the form

  ```purs
  instance SomeClass (f a) where ...
  ```

  in order to cause it.
