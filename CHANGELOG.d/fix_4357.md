* Fix name clash in guard clauses introduced in #4293

  As a consequence, a problem with the compiler not being able to see
  imported names if they're shadowed by a guard binder is also solved.
  ```purs
  import Data.Foldable (fold)
  import Data.Maybe (Maybe(..))
  import Data.Monoid.Additive (Additive(..))

  test :: Maybe Int -> Int
  test = case _ of
    m | Just fold <- m -> fold
      -- Previously would complain about `fold` being undefined
      | otherwise -> case fold [] of Additive x -> x
  ```
