* Account for typed holes when checking value declarations

  The compiler now takes into account typed holes when ordering value declarations
  for type checking, allowing more top-level values to be suggested instead of
  being limited by reverse lexicographical ordering.

  Given:
  ```purescript
  module Main where

  newtype K = K Int

  aRinku :: Int -> K
  aRinku = K

  bMaho :: K
  bMaho = ?help 0

  cMuni :: Int -> K
  cMuni = K

  dRei :: Int -> K
  dRei _ = bMaho
  ```

  Before:
  ```
    Hole 'help' has the inferred type
            
      Int -> K
            
    You could substitute the hole with one of these values:
                           
      Main.cMuni  :: Int -> K
      Main.K      :: Int -> K
  ```

  After:
  ```
    Hole 'help' has the inferred type
            
      Int -> K
            
    You could substitute the hole with one of these values:
                            
      Main.aRinku  :: Int -> K
      Main.cMuni   :: Int -> K
      Main.K       :: Int -> K
  ```
