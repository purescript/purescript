* Fix replicated type hole suggestions due to malformed source spans

  In PureScript `0.15.4`, the following code will produce multiple entries in
  the type hole suggestions. This is due to malformed source spans that are
  generated when desugaring value declarations into case expressions.

  ```purs
  module Main where

  data F = X | Y

  f :: forall a. F -> a -> a
  f X b = ?help
  f Y b = ?help
  ```
