-- | The data type for an intermediate stage which we go through during
-- converting.
--
-- In the first pass, we take all top level declarations in the module, and
-- collect other information which will later be used to augment the top level
-- declarations. These two situation correspond to the Right and Left
-- constructors, respectively.
--
-- In the second pass, we go over all of the Left values and augment the
-- relevant declarations, leaving only the augmented Right values.
--
-- Note that in the Left case, we provide a [Text] as well as augment
-- information. The [Text] value should be a list of titles of declarations
-- that the augmentation should apply to. For example, for a type instance
-- declaration, that would be any types or type classes mentioned in the
-- instance. For a fixity declaration, it would be just the relevant operator's
-- name.

-- | Some data which will be used to augment a Declaration in the

-- The AugmentChild constructor allows us to move all children under their

-- since they appear at the top level in the AST, and since they might need to
-- appear as children in two places (for example, if a data type defined in a
-- module is an instance of a type class also defined in that module).
