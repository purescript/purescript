-- | An intermediate stage which we go through during rendering.
--
-- In the first pass, we take all top level declarations in the module, and
-- render those which should appear at the top level in the output, as well as
-- those which should appear as children of other declarations in the output.
--
-- In the second pass, we move all children under their respective parents,
-- or discard them if none are found.
--
-- This two-pass system is only necessary for type instance declarations, since
-- they appear at the top level in the AST, and since they might need to appear
-- as children in two places (for example, if a data type defined in a module
-- is an instance of a type class also defined in that module).
--
-- This data type is used as an intermediate type between the two stages. The
-- Left case is a child declaration, together with a list of parent declaration
-- titles which this may appear as a child of.
--
-- The Right case is a top level declaration which should pass straight through
-- the second stage; the only way it might change is if child declarations are
-- added to it.
