-- This module is responsible for ensuring that the bindings in recursive
-- binding groups are initialized in a valid order, introducing run-time
-- laziness and initialization checks as necessary.
--
-- PureScript is a call-by-value language with strict data constructors, this
-- transformation notwithstanding. The only laziness introduced here is in the
-- initialization of a binding. PureScript is uninterested in the order in
-- which bindings are written by the user. The compiler has always attempted to
-- emit the bindings in an order that makes sense for the backend, but without
-- this transformation, recursive bindings are emitted in an arbitrary order,
-- which can cause unexpected behavior at run time if a binding is dereferenced
-- before it has initialized.
--
-- To prevent unexpected errors, this transformation does a syntax-driven
-- analysis of a single recursive binding group to attempt to statically order
-- the bindings, and when that fails, falls back to lazy initializers that will
-- succeed or fail deterministically with a clear error at run time.
--
-- Example:
--
--   x = f \_ ->
--     x
--
-- becomes (with some details of the $runtime_lazy function elided):
-- 
--   -- the binding of x has been rewritten as a lazy initializer
--   $lazy_x = $runtime_lazy \_ ->
--     f \_ ->
--       $lazy_x 2  -- the reference to x has been rewritten as a force call
--   x = $lazy_x 1
--
-- Central to this analysis are the concepts of delay and force, which are
-- attributes given to every subexpression in the binding group. Delay and
-- force are defined by the following traversal. This traversal is used twice:
-- once to collect all the references made by each binding in the group, and
-- then again to rewrite some references to force calls. (The implications of
-- delay and force on initialization order are specified later.)

-- |
-- Visits every `Var` in an expression with the provided function, including
-- the amount of delay and force applied to that `Var`, and substitutes the
-- result back into the tree (propagating an `Applicative` effect).
--
-- Delay is a non-negative integer that represents the number of lambdas that
-- enclose an expression. Force is a non-negative integer that represents the
-- number of values that are being applied to an expression. Delay is always
-- statically determinable, but force can be *unknown*, so it's represented
-- here with a Maybe. In a function application `f a b`, `f` has force 2, but
-- `a` and `b` have unknown force--it depends on what `f` does with them.
--
-- The rules of assigning delay and force are simple:
--   * The expressions that are assigned to bindings in this group have
--     delay 0, force 0.
--   * In a function application, the function expression has force 1 higher
--     than the force of the application expression, and the argument
--     expression has unknown force.
--     * UNLESS this argument is being directly provided to a constructor (in
--       other words, the function expression is either a constructor itself or
--       a constructor that has already been partially applied), in which case
--       the force of both subexpressions is unchanged. We can assume that
--       constructors don't apply any additional force to their arguments.
--   * If the force of a lambda is zero, the delay of the body of the lambda is
--     incremented; otherwise, the force of the body of the lambda is
--     decremented. (Applying one argument to a lambda cancels out one unit of
--     delay.)
--   * In the argument of a Case and the bindings of a Let, force is unknown.
--   * Everywhere else, preserve the delay and force of the enclosing
--     expression.
--
-- Here are some illustrative examples of the above rules. We will use a
-- pseudocode syntax to annotate a subexpression with delay and force:
-- `expr#d!f` means `expr` has delay d and force f. `!*` is used to denote
-- unknown force.
--
--   x = y#0!0
--   x = y#0!2 a#0!* b#0!*
--   x = (\_ -> y#1!0)#0!0
--   x = \_ _ -> y#2!1 a#2!*
--   x = (\_ -> y#0!0)#0!1 z#0!*
--   x = Just { a: a#0!0, b: b#0!0 }
--   x = let foo = (y#1!* a b#1!*)#1!* in foo + 1
--
-- (Note that this analysis is quite ignorant of any actual control flow
-- choices made at run time. It doesn't even track what happens to a reference
-- after it has been locally bound by a Let or Case. Instead, it just assumes
-- the worst--once locally bound to a new name, it imagines that absolutely
-- anything could happen to that new name and thus to the underlying reference.
-- But the value-to-weight ratio of this approach is perhaps surprisingly
-- high.)
--
-- Every subexpression gets a delay and a force, but we are only interested
-- in references to other bindings in the binding group, so the traversal only
-- exposes `Var`s to the provided function.

-- Once we assign a delay and force value to every `Var` in the binding group,
-- we can consider how to order the bindings to allow them all to successfully
-- initialize. There is one principle here: each binding must be initialized
-- before the identifier being bound is ready for use. If the preorder thus
-- induced has cycles, those cycles need to be resolved with laziness. All of
-- the details concern what "ready for use" means.
--
-- The definition of delay and force suggests that "ready for use" depends on
-- those attributes. If a lambda is bound to the name x, then the references in
-- the lambda don't need to be initialized before x is initialized. This is
-- represented by the fact that those references have non-zero delay. But if
-- the expression bound to x is instead the application of a function y that is
-- also bound in this binding group, then not only does y need to be
-- initialized before x, so do some of the non-zero delay references in y. This
-- is represented by the fact that the occurrence of y in the expression bound
-- to x has non-zero force.
--
-- An example, reusing the pseudocode annotations defined above:
--
--   x _ = y#1!0
--   y = x#0!1 a
--
-- y doesn't need to be initialized before x is, because the reference to y in
-- x's initializer has delay 1. But y does need to be initialized before x is
-- ready for use with force 1, because force 1 is enough to overcome the delay
-- of that reference. And since y has a delay-0 reference to x with force 1, y
-- will need to be ready for use before it is initialized; thus, y needs to be
-- made lazy.
--
-- So just as function applications "cancel out" lambdas, a known applied force
-- cancels out an equal amount of delay, causing some references that may not
-- have been needed earlier to enter play. (And to be safe, we must assume that
-- unknown force cancels out *any* amount of delay.) There is another, subtler
-- aspect of this: if there are not enough lambdas to absorb every argument
-- applied to a function, those arguments will end up applied to the result of
-- the function. Likewise, if there is excess force left over after some of it
-- has been canceled by delay, that excess is carried to the references
-- activated. (Again, an unknown amount of force must be assumed to lead to an
-- unknown amount of excess force.)
--
-- Another example:
--
--   f = g#0!2 a b
--   g x = h#1!2 c x
--   h _ _ _ = f#3!0
--
-- Initializing f will lead to an infinite loop in this example. f invokes g
-- with two arguments. g absorbs one argument, and the second ends up being
-- applied to the result of h c x, resulting in h being invoked with three
-- arguments. Invoking h with three arguments results in dereferencing f, which
-- is not yet ready. To capture this loop in our analysis, we say that making
-- f ready for use with force 0 requires making g ready for use with force 2,
-- which requires making h ready for use with force 3 (two units of force from
-- the lexical position of h, plus one unit of excess force carried forward),
-- which cyclically requires f to be ready for use with force 0.
--
-- These preceding observations are captured and generalized by the following
-- rules:
--
--   USE-INIT: Before a reference to x is ready for use with any force, x must
--     be initialized.
--
--     We will make x lazy iff this rule induces a cycle--i.e., initializing x
--     requires x to be ready for use first.
--
--   USE-USE: Before a reference to x is ready for use with force f:
--     * if a reference in the initializer of x has delay d and force f',
--     * and either d <= f or f is unknown,
--     * then that reference must itself be ready for use with
--       force f – d + f' (or with unknown force if f or f' is unknown).
--
--   USE-IMMEDIATE: Initializing a binding x is equivalent to requiring a
--     reference to x to be ready for use with force 0, per USE-USE.
--     
--     Equivalently: before x is initialized, any reference in the initializer
--     of x with delay 0 and force f must be ready for use with force f.
--
-- Examples:
--
--   Assume x is bound in a recursive binding group with the below bindings.
--
--   All of the following initializers require x to be ready for use with some
--   amount of force, and therefore require x to be initialized first.
--
--   a = x#0!0
--   b = (\_ -> x#0!0) 1
--   c = foo x#0!*
--   d = (\_ -> foo x#0!*) 1
--
--   In the following initializers, before p can be initialized, x must be
--   ready for use with force f – d + f'. (And both x and q must be
--   initialized, of course; but x being ready for use with that force may
--   induce additional constraints.)
--
--   p = ... q#0!f ...
--   q = ... x#d!f' ... (where d <= f)
--
--   Excess force stacks, of course: in the following initializers, before r
--   can be initialized, x must be ready for use with force
--   f — d + f' — d' + f'':
--
--   r = ... s#0!f ...
--   s = ... t#d!f' ... (where d <= f)
--   t = ... x#d'!f'' ... (where d' <= f – d + f')
--
--
-- To satisfy these rules, we will construct a graph between (identifier,
-- delay) pairs, with edges induced by the USE-USE rule, and effectively run a
-- topsort to get the initialization preorder. For this part, it's simplest to
-- think of delay as an element of the naturals extended with a positive
-- infinity, corresponding to an unknown amount of force. (We'll do arithmetic
-- on these extended naturals as you would naively expect; we won't do anything
-- suspect like subtracting infinity from infinity.) With that in mind, we can
-- construct the graph as follows: for each reference from i1 to i2 with delay
-- d and force f, draw an infinite family of edges from (i1, d + n) to (i2, f +
-- n) for all 0 <= n <= ∞, where n represents the excess force carried over
-- from a previous edge. Unfortunately, as an infinite graph, we can't expect
-- the tools in Data.Graph to help us traverse it; we will have to be a little
-- bit clever.
--
-- The following data types and functions are for searching this infinite graph
-- and carving from it a finite amount of data to work with. Specifically, we
-- want to know for each identifier i, which other identifiers are
-- irreflexively reachable from (i, 0) (and thus must be initialized before i
-- is), and with what maximum force (in the event of a loop, not every
-- reference to i in the reachable identifier needs to be rewritten to a force
-- call; only the ones with delay up to the maximum force used during i's
-- initialization). We also want the option of aborting a given reachability
-- search, for one of two reasons.
--
--   * If we encounter a reference with unknown force, abort.
--   * If we encounter a cycle where force on a single identifier is
--     increasing, abort. (Because of USE-USE, as soon as an identifier is
--     revisited with greater force than its first visit, the difference is
--     carried forward as excess, so it is possible to retrace that path to get
--     an arbitrarily high amount of force.)
--
-- Both reasons mean that it is theoretically possible for the identifier in
-- question to need every other identifier in the binding group to be
-- initialized before it is. (Every identifier in a recursive binding group is
-- necessarily reachable from every other, ignoring delay and force, which is
-- what arbitrarily high force lets you do.)
--
-- In order to reuse parts of this reachability computation across identifiers,
-- we are going to represent it with a rose tree data structure interleaved with
-- a monad capturing the abort semantics. (The monad is Maybe, but we don't
-- need to know that here!)

type MaxRoseTree m a = m (IM.MonoidalIntMap (MaxRoseNode m a))
data MaxRoseNode m a = MaxRoseNode a (MaxRoseTree m a)

-- Dissecting this data structure:
--
-- m (...)
-- ^ represents whether to abort or continue the search
--
--   IM.MonoidalIntMap (...)
--   ^ the keys of this map are other identifiers reachable from the current
--     one (we'll map the identifiers in this binding group to Ints for ease of
--     computation)
--
--     the values of this map are:
--
--     MaxRoseNode a (...)
--     ^ this will store the force applied to the next identifier
--       (MaxRoseTree m a)
--       ^ and this, the tree of identifiers reachable from there
--
-- We're only interested in continuing down the search path that applies the
-- most force to a given identifier! So when we combine two MaxRoseTrees,
-- we want to resolve any key collisions in their MonoidalIntMaps with this
-- semigroup:

instance Ord a => Semigroup (MaxRoseNode m a) where
  l@(MaxRoseNode l1 _) <> r@(MaxRoseNode r1 _) = if r1 > l1 then r else l

-- And that's why this is called a MaxRoseTree.
--
-- Traversing this tree to get a single MonoidalIntMap with the entire closure
-- plus force information is fairly straightforward:

mrtFlatten :: (Monad m, Ord a) => MaxRoseTree m a -> m (IM.MonoidalIntMap (Max a))
mrtFlatten = (getAp . IM.foldMapWithKey (\i (MaxRoseNode a inner) -> Ap $ (IM.singleton i (Max a) <>) <$> mrtFlatten inner) =<<)

-- The use of the `Ap` monoid ensures that if any child of this tree aborts,
-- the entire tree aborts.
--
-- One might ask, why interleave the abort monad with the tree at all if we're
-- just going to flatten it out at the end? The point is to flatten it out at
-- the end, but *not* during the generation of the tree. Attempting to flatten
-- the tree as we generate it can result in an infinite loop, because a subtree
-- needs to be exhaustively searched for abort conditions before it can be used
-- in another tree. With this approach, we can use lazy trees as building
-- blocks and, as long as they get rewritten to be finite or have aborts before
-- they're flattened, the analysis still terminates.
