cache:
# Travis CI's build cache mechanism allows you to cache compiled artifacts in
# order to speed subsequent builds up; this is essential for us, because
# installing all of the compiler's Haskell dependencies takes longer than the
# allotted time for a single build.
#
# Unfortunately, if we allow a build to reach the Travis timeout limit, we
# don't get the opportunity to upload a cache (since uploading is included in
# the time limit, and we've already run out of time).  Therefore, if we want
# the progress we have made in a build to be saved to the build cache, we need
# to make sure we abort the build early to allow time to upload the cache.
# Then, the next commit can pick up where the previous commit left off.
#
# If a CI build times out, you need to push a new commit. Amending and
# force-pushing DOES NOT WORK. I suspect this is because Travis will only
# consider a particular build cache to be appropriate to use when building a
# given commit with if the cache was created by a parent of the commit being
# built (which is sensible of them).

  # For some reason, stack doesn't install GHC inside the STACK_ROOT on
  # windows.
  - C:/Users/travis/AppData/Local/Programs/stack
  # Maximum amount of time in seconds spent attempting to upload a new cache
  # before aborting. Since our cache can get rather large, increasing this
  # value helps avoid situations where caches fail to be stored. The default
  # value is 180 (at the time of writing).
