# As of 2021-11-08, the latest release of `language-javascript` is 0.7.1.0,
# but it has a problem with parsing the `async` keyword.  It doesn't allow

# Fix issue with libtinfo.

# hspec versions 2.9.3 to 2.10.6 depend on ghc
# ghc depends on terminfo by default, but that can be ignored
# if one uses the '-terminfo' flag.
# Unfortunately, hspec doesn't expose a similar flag.
#
# Using hspec >= 2.10.7 addresses this.
