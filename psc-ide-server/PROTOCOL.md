# Protocol

Encode the following JSON formats into a single line string and pass them to
`psc-ide-client`s stdin. You can then read the result from `psc-ide-client`s
stdout as a single line. The result needs to be unwrapped from the "wrapper"
which separates success from failure. This wrapper is described at the end of
this document.

## Command:
### Load
The `load` command "loads" the requested modules into the server for completion
and type info. If the `params` object is left off, the `load` command will try
to detect all the compiled modules in your project and load them.

**Params:**
 - `modules :: (optional) [ModuleName]`: A list of modules to load.
  psc-ide-server will try to parse all the declarations in these modules
 - `dependencies :: (optional) [ModuleName]`: A list of modules to load 
  including their dependencies. In contrast to the `module` field, all the
  imports in these Modules will also be loaded.

```json
{
  "command": "load",
  "params": (optional) {
    "modules": (optional)["Module.Name1", "Module.Name2"],
    "dependencies": (optional)["Module.Name3"]
  }
}
```

**Result:**

The Load Command returns a string.

### Type
The `type` command looks up the type for a given identifier.

**Params:**
 - `search :: String`: The identifier to look for. Only matches on equality.
 - `filters :: [Filter]`: These filters will be applied before looking for the
  identifier. These filters get combined with *AND*, so a candidate must match *ALL*
  of them to be eligible.
```json
{
  "command": "type",
  "params": {
    "search": "filterM",
    "filters": [Filter]
  }
}
```

**Result:**
The possible types are returned in the same format as completions

### Complete
The `complete` command looks up possible completions/corrections.

**Params**:
 - `filters :: [Filter]`: The same as for the `type` command. A candidate must match
  all filters.
 - `matcher :: (optional) Matcher`: The strategy used for matching candidates after filtering.
  Results are scored internally and will be returned in the descending order where
  the nth element is better then the n+1-th.

  If no matcher is given every candidate, that passes the filters, is returned in no 
  particular order.
```json
{
  "command": "complete",
  "params": {
    "filters": [Filter],
    "matcher": (optional) Matcher
  }
}
```

**Result:**

The following format is returned as the Result:

```json
[
  {
  "module": "Data.Array",
  "identifier": "filter",
  "type": "forall a. (a -> Boolean) -> Array a -> Array a"
  }
]
```


### CaseSplit 

The CaseSplit command takes a line of source code, an area in that line of code
and replaces it with all patterns for a given type. The parameter `annotations`
is used to turn type annotations on or off for the constructor fields.

```json
{
 "command": "caseSplit",
 "params": {
  "line": "elem a as",
  "begin": 8,
  "end": 10,
  "annotations": true,
  "type": "List"
 }
}
```

**Result:**

The following format is returned as the Result:

```json
[
  "elem a Nil",
  "elem a (Cons (_ :: a) (_ :: List a))"
]
```
You should then be able to replace the affected line of code in the editor with the new suggestions.

### Add Clause

The AddClause command takes a typedeclaration and generates a function template for the given type.
The `annotations` option turns type annotations on or off for the function arguments.

```json
{
 "command": "addClause",
 "params": {
  "line": "elem :: forall a. (Eq a) => a -> List a",
  "annotations": true
 }
}
```

**Result:**

The following format is returned as the Result:

```json
[
  "elem :: forall a. (Eq a) => a -> List a",
  "elem ( _ :: a) = ?elem"
]
```
You should then be able to replace the affected line of code in the editor with the new suggestions.

### Import

For now all of the import related commands work with a file on the filesystem.

You can specify it with the `file` parameter.

If you supply the optional `outfile` parameter, the output will be written to
that file, and an info message will be returned from the client.

If you don't supply `outfile`, the server responds with a list of strings which,
when inserted into a file linewise create the module with the applied changes.

Arguments:

- `file` :: String
- `outfile` :: Maybe String
- `filters` :: Maybe [Filter]

Example:

```json
{
  "command": "import",
  "params": {
    "file": "/home/creek/Documents/chromacannon/src/Main.purs",
    "outfile": "/home/creek/Documents/chromacannon/src/Main.purs",
    "filters": [{
      "filter": "modules",
      "params": {
        "modules": ["My.Module"]
      }
    }],
    "importCommand": {
      "yadda": "yadda"
    }
  }
}
```


#### Subcommand `addImplicitImport`

This command just adds an unqualified import for the given modulename.

Arguments:
- `moduleName :: String`

Example:
```json
{
  "command": "import",
  "params": {
    "file": "/home/creek/Documents/chromacannon/src/Main.purs",
    "importCommand": {
      "importCommand": "addImplicitImport",
      "module": "Data.Array.LOL"
    }
  }
}
```
#### Subcommand `addImport`

This command takes an identifier and searches the currently loaded modules for
it. If it finds no matches it responds with an Error. If it finds exactly one
match it adds the import and returns. If it finds more than one match it
responds with a list of the found matches as completions like the complete
command.

You can also supply a list of filters like the ones for completion. This way you
can narrow down the search to a certain module and resolve the case in which
more then one match was found.

Arguments:
- `moduleName :: String`
- `filters :: [Filter]`

Example:
```json
{
  "command": "import",
  "params": {
    "file": "/home/creek/Documents/chromacannon/src/Demo.purs",
    "outfile": "/home/creek/Documents/chromacannon/src/Demo.purs",
    "importCommand": {
      "importCommand": "addImport",
      "identifier": "bind"
    } 
  }
} 
```

### Rebuild

The `rebuild` command provides a fast rebuild for a single module. It doesn't
recompile the entire project though. All the modules dependencies need to be
loaded.

Arguments:
- `file :: String` the path to the module to rebuild

```json
{
  "command": "rebuild",
  "params": {
    "file": "/path/to/file.purs"
  }
}
```

**Result**

In the Success case you get a list of warnings in the compilers json format.

In the Error case you get the errors in the compilers json format

### Pursuit
The `pursuit` command looks up the packages/completions for a given identifier from Pursuit.

**Params:**
 - `query :: String`: With `type: "package"` this should be a module name. With
   `type: "completion"` this can be any string to look up.
 - `type :: String`: Takes the following values:
   - `package`: Looks for packages that contain the given module name.
   - `completion` Looks for declarations for the query from Pursuit.

```json
{
  "command": "pursuit",
  "params": {
    "query": "Data.Array",
    "type": "package"
  }
}
```

**Result:**

`package` returns:

```json
[
  {
  "module": "Module1.Name",
  "package": "purescript-packagename"
  }
]
```

`completion` returns:

```json
[
  {
  "module": "Data.Array",
  "identifier": "filter",
  "type": "forall a. (a -> Boolean) -> Array a -> Array a",
  "package": "purescript-arrays"
  }
]
```

### List

#### Loaded Modules

`list` of type `loadedModules` lists all loaded modules (This means they can be searched for completions etc)

```json
{
  "command": "list",
  "params": {
    "type": "loadedModules"
  }
}
```

#### Response:

The list loadedModules command returns a list of strings.

#### Available Modules

`list` of type `availableModules` lists all available modules. (This basically
means the contents of the `output/` folder.))

```json
{
  "command": "list",
  "params": {
    "type": "availableModules"
  }
}
```

#### Response:

The list availableModules command returns a list of strings.

#### Imports

The list commmand can also list the imports for a given file.

```json
{
  "command": "list",
  "params": {
    "type": "import",
    "file": "/home/kritzcreek/Documents/psc-ide/examples/Main.purs"
  }
}
```

#### Response:

The list import command returns a list of imports where imports are of the following form:

Implicit Import(`import Data.Array`):
```json
[
  {
  "module": "Data.Array",
  "importType": "implicit"
  }
]
```

Implicit qualified Import(`import qualified Data.Array as A`):
```json
[
  {
  "module": "Data.Array",
  "importType": "implicit",
  "qualifier": "A"
  }
]
```

Explicit Import(`import Data.Array (filter, filterM, join)`):
```json
[
  {
  "module": "Data.Array",
  "importType": "explicit",
  "identifiers": ["filter", "filterM", "join"]
  }
]
```

Hiding Import(`import Data.Array hiding (filter, filterM, join)`):
```json
[
  {
  "module": "Data.Array",
  "importType": "hiding",
  "identifiers": ["filter", "filterM", "join"]
  }
]
```
### Cwd/Quit/Reset
`cwd` returns the working directory of the server(should be your project root).

`quit` quits the server.

`reset` resets all loaded modules.

```json
{
  "command": "cwd|quit|reset"
}
```

**Result:**
These commands return strings.

## Filter:

### Exact filter
The Exact filter only keeps identifiers that are equal to the search term.

```json
{
  "filter": "exact",
  "params": {
    "search": "filterM"
  }
}
```
### Prefix filter
The Prefix filter keeps identifiers/modules/data declarations that
are prefixed by the search term.

```json
{
   "filter": "prefix",
   "params": {
     "search": "filt"
   }
}
```

### Module filter
The Module filter only keeps identifiers that appear in the listed modules.

```json
{
   "filter": "modules",
   "params": {
     "modules": ["My.Module"]
   }
}
```

### Dependency filter
The Dependency filter only keeps identifiers that appear in the listed modules
and in any of their dependencies/imports.

```json
{
  "filter": "dependencies",
  "params": {
    "modules": ["My.Module"]
  }
}
```

## Matcher:

### Flex matcher
Matches any occurence of the search string with intersections

The scoring measures how far the matches span the string, where
closer is better. The matches then get sorted with highest score first.

Examples:
- flMa matches **fl**ex**Ma**tcher. Score: 14.28
- sons matches **so**rtCompletio**ns**. Score: 6.25
```json

{
  "matcher": "flex",
  "params": {
    "search": "filt"
  }
}
```

### Distance Matcher

The Distance matcher is meant to provide corrections for typos. It calculates
the edit distance in between the search and the loaded identifiers.

```json
{
  "matcher": "distance",
  "params": {
    "search": "dilterM",
    "maximumDistance": 3
  }
}
```

## Responses

All Responses are wrapped in the following format:

```json
{
  "resultType": "success|error",
  "result": Result|Error
}
```

### Error

Errors at this point are merely Error strings. Newlines are escaped like `\n`
and should be taken care of by the editor-plugin.
