  One or more type variables are in positions that prevent [33mContravariant[0m from being derived.
  To derive this class, make sure that these variables are only used as the final arguments to type constructors, that their variance matches the variance of [33mContravariant[0m, and that those type constructors themselves have instances of [33mData.Functor.Functor[0m, [33mData.Bifunctor.Bifunctor[0m, [33mData.Functor.Contravariant.Contravariant[0m, or [33mData.Profunctor.Profunctor[0m.
