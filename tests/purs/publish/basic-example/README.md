This directory contains a basic synthetic example project for testing `purs
publish` with. Although it claims to depend upon `purescript-prelude`,
`purescript-console`, and `purescript-effect`, we don't reproduce the real
libraries here; instead, we just provide a couple of declarations for the
purpose of testing.
