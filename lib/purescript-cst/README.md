# purescript-cst

The parser for the PureScript programming language was temporarily released as a separate package for the `0.14.x` series. In `0.15.x`, it was merged back into the main `purescript` package. This table only exists for documentary purposes.

## Compiler compatibility

In `v0.15.0`, the `purescript-cst` package was merged back into the `purescript` package.

We provide a table to make it a bit easier to map between versions of `purescript` and `purescript-cst`.

| `purescript` | `purescript-cst` |
| --- | --- |
| 0.14.2 | 0.2.0.0 |
| 0.14.3 | 0.3.0.0 |
| 0.14.4 | 0.4.0.0 |
| 0.14.5 | 0.4.0.0 |
| 0.14.6 | 0.4.0.0 |
| 0.14.7 | 0.5.0.0 |

Before v0.14.2, there was a third package, `purescript-ast`. In v0.14.2, `purescript-ast` was merged into `purescript-cst`.

| `purescript` | `purescript-cst` | `purescript-ast` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0.14.1 | 0.1.1.0 | 0.1.1.0 |
| 0.14.0 | 0.1.0.0 | 0.1.0.0 |
